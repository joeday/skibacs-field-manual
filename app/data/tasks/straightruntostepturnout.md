### Why it's important

We're skiing! It's about gliding forward on skis and developing familiarity with that sensation.

### How to do it

Straight run with the fall line for about 10 feet (or to a comfortable speed), then using small steps step in one direction across the fall line until you come to a stop.

### What to look for

When the ski is lifted to make a step, is the tip coming up? Or is the ski level? Or is the tail higher? Staying forward enables a level ski, or one where the tail is higher. You want to avoid having the tip be higher as it indicates the athletic stance has been lost and the pressure is toward the back. Keeping the core engaged is a great way to enable maintaining athletic stance.

### Other things you can do

Straight run while alternating lifting each tail of the ski to promote staying in athletic stance and forward. It helps to remind them to keep the core engaged while lifting the tail of the ski. SECONDARY: Instead of stepping, try it while shuffling. TIP: Demonstrate across fall line if terrain is too steep.
