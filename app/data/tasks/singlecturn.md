### Why it's important

Developing the feel of one complete turn and all the benefits that come with it, like controlling speed and being able to stop.

### How to do it

In a #1 or #2 wedge, direct balance to the outside ski to show one single turn. Demonstrate shoulders staying level with the slope, diagonal movements of the feet and knees to engage edges, shin to cuff pressure, flexing and extending the ankles, knees, hips and spine. Everything orchestrated together to make one single turn.

### What to look for

Diagonal movement of the feet, ankles, and knees. Quiet upper body.
