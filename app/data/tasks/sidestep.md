### Why it's important

Equips studendts to be able to move up and down the fall line when needed, by developing a feel for using the edges of their skis.

### How to do it

Introduce the concept of the fall line - it's the direction a basketball would travel on it's own down the hill. Have the student stand with their skis across the fall line while moving their knees slightly into the hill to develop a small edge angle. Then have them take small steps up and small steps down.

### What to look for

Make sure the edges have purchase and are not slipping. Some students may need to exaggerate moving their knees into the hill to get the edge to grab.
