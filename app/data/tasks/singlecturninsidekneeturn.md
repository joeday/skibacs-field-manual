### Why it's important

Developing the feel of one complete turn focusing on steering movements.

### How to do it

Focus on the inside leg. In a #1 or #2 wedge, flatten the ski to release the edge and nudge the inside ski knee toward the direction of the turn while directing pressure to the outside ski.

### What to look for

Flat inside ski, should almost resemble tip chases, but with a little bit more pressure on the outside ski.
