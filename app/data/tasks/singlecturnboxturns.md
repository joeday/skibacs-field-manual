### Why it's important

Developing the feel of changing the radius of the turn from shorter to longer.

### How to do it

Set the poles up so that the skier must ski around 2 poles (instead of 1) per turn so that it results in a larger turn shape.

### What to look for

One gradual turn instead of multiple turn movements.
