### Why it's important

Equips students to be able to glide across a hill without sliding down. Very useful tool to make uncomfortably steep terrain more manageable.

### How to do it

Start in athletic stance, and glide across the fall leaving two clean lines in the snow. Be sure to demonstrate ankles, knees, and hips moving diagonally to engage and release edges. Step uphill to stop.

### What to look for

Two clean lines left in the snow, no smearing. Diagonal movements of feet, knees, and hip to engage and release edges. Flexing and extending ankles.
