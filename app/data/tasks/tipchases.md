### Why it's important

Equips students to be able to turn their feet using their legs instead of with their upper body with a focus on steering movements.

### How to do it

Starting in a #1 or #2 size wedge, rotate your inside foot to steer the tip of the ski, and have the other tip follow it. The goal is to steer both feet simiultaneously with a flat ski. Can begin as a small wiggle, and develop into something more gradual and round. Finish the last turn across the fall line in a slow looong J turn.

### What to look for

Skis steering side to side while the upper body remains quiet. Hips and shoulders should remain pointing down the hill while the feet move underneath.

### Other things you can do

Game: Traffic cop.
