### Why it's important

Builds on side stepping, while giving students a way to move forward and uphill using their edges.

### How to do it

Have the student make a V with their skis facing up the fall line. Focus on shin/cuff pressure directed slightly inward diagonally. Take a step, followed by another.

### What to look for

Clean lines left in the snow with no smearing. Skis that a smearing or slipping might be caused by too little cuff pressure, or too little inward diagonal movement at the knees.

### Other things you can do

Walk like a penguin! Pair them up and have them chase each other around and play tag. They might actuall start skating!
