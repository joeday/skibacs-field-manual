### Why it's important

Help students get used to the feel of having skis on their feet.

### How to do it

Have the students put their skis on and take them off again. Explain the skis, bindings, and poles.

Skis - talk about the shape, the base, and the edges.

Bindings - talk about how to get in and out, pointing out the how the brake works.

### What to look for

Make sure their boots fit their bindings. If they don't, send them to the rental shop or repair shop to have a certified tech make adjustments.

IMPORTANT: We do not adjust bindings.

### Other things you can do

Step in place. Hop in place. Flex low to extend tall. This is where they begin to feel the sensation of their shins pressing on the cuffs of their boots.
