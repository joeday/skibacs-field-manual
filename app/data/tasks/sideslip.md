### Why it's important

Enables controlled sideways movement down hill.

### How to do it

You'll need a bit steeper of a pitch for this one. Begin with skis across the fall line. Demonstrate releasing the edges by extending uphill leg to flatten skis while keeping torso somewhat down the hill in the direction of the slip. To engage the edges, flex ankles while directing knees and hip diagonally into the the hill.

### What to look for

Movements happening in the feet, ankles, knees, and hips while the upper body remains quiet.

### Other things you can try

How far can you go without slipping?
