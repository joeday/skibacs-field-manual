### Why it's important

Developing the feel of one complete turn focusing on pressuring the outside ski.

### How to do it

While making a single turn, drag the outside pole on the snow through the length of the turn while simultaneously pressing the outside ski. Focus on pressuring the outside ski.

### What to look for

What is the relationship of the shoulders to the slope? Under exaggerated? Have them press the pole more. Over exaggerated? Have them press the pole less as long as they are still directing pressure to the outside ski.
