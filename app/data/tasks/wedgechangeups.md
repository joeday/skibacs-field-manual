### Why it's important

Changing wedge size while skiing equips students with a basic method of speed and edge control.

### How to do it

Begin in a straight run in athletic stance, then rotate the legs into a wedge position. Then back into a straight run. The tracks you leave in the snow should be straight, then smeared, then back to straight. Be sure to demonstrate cuff pressure and ankle flexion throughout.

### What to look for

Ankles flexing and engaged, feet turning independent of the upper body.

### Other things you can do

Stationery - brushing the heels out. Spreading the peanut butter.

Contest - how many can you do between here and there? Or, to emphasizes longer length of glide and wedge, how few can you do between here and there?
