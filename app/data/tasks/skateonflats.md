### Why it's important

Equips students to be able to get around on flats more quickly while continuing to develop both edging and balance skills.

### How to do it

On flat terrain, have students start in herringbone. Demonstrate pushing off one ski and gliding on the other. Sometimes it helps to have them count for the duration of the glide that you're trying to develop so they don't rush it.

### What to look for

A distinct glide on a flat ski that gradually rolls into an edged ski to push off of. Note the relationship between fundamentals: in order to maximize use of the edges, it is essential to be working fore/aft. When these are in harmony, you'll see a rhythmic, balanced, diagonal motion.

### Other things you can do

Challenge games! Who can do the fewest skates from here to there (emphasizes glide and getting detailed in moving from a flat to an edged ski). Also, you can try a relay race.
