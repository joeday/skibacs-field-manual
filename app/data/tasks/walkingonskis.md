### Why it's important

Starting to introduce mobility and movement on skis. This can help them get around on the kinds of flats they'll experience in lift lines or similar places.

### How to do it

With one ski on, have the student walk around in circles, then straight, then adding a little glide into it. After that, have them do it with both skis on.

### Other things you can do

Figure 8 on one ski, then on two. You can use this to talk about how our feet & legs move separately from our upper body (fundamental 4).
