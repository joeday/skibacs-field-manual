### Why it's important

Introduces the concept basis for turning. It's all about feet moving separate of the upper body.

### How to do it

Stationary demo while standing: lift one ski off the ground and rotate it back and forth. Place a pole in the snow, lift a ski and press against the pole.

### Other things you can do

Make bowties with your boots in the snow. Or if the snow is firm, you can do boot skiing with mini steering movements without skis. Or with one ski on, place your ski on the binding of the ski that's off and show pivot/steering motion.
