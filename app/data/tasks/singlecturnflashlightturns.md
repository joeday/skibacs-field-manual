### Why it's important

Developing the feel of one complete turn. Flashlight turns are very versatile and can be used to highlight different fundamentals.

### How to do it

Imagine it's dark outside and your kneecaps are headlights illuminating the direction you're going. Move the flashlights toward the direction of the turn while directing pressure to the outside ski.

### What to look for

If you're turning by cuff pressure, are the ankles and knees flexing?

If you're turning by edge movements, are the ankles and knees moving diagonally toward the turn?

If you're turning by steering movements, are the feet moving separate to the upper body?

You can also look for a blend of all of these movements.
