### Why it's important

Helps students begin to experience movement, balance, and stance on one ski.

### How to do it

With one ski on, have them glide on a gentle slope while maintaining shin/cuff pressure. When gliding, demonstate keeping your foot without the ski behind the other foot as this helps keep shin/cuff pressure.

### What to look for

Can they leave a clean line behind?

### Other things you can do

There are some fun games to play with this one: Red light, green light, go! Relay race where they team up and have to pass a batan (a glove?). Shuffle and hop. Mix it up and keep it fun!
