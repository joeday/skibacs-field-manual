### Why it's important

Linked turns are fun! They also are a prerequisite for getting on the chair.

### How to do it

Collect everyone's poles and set up a slalom course and have the students make turns around the poles, coming to a stop after the last one.

### What to look for

This is a great point to give specific feedback on the various things you've been teaching: Feet turning underneath upper body, quiet upper body, athletic stance, flexing and extending ankles, etc...
