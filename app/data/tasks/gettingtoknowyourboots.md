### Why it's important

Help students get used to the feel of their feet in boots. Boots are the one of the most important pieces of gear we use, and it's not always apparent for new students which feet they go on, or how the buckles work.

### How to do it

After checking that their boots are on the correct feet, buckled, and properly sized to their bindings, have them do a few movements to develop familiarity: walk around, tip them from side to side, pivot them to make bowties in the snow, hop in place, slide on boots only.

### What to look for

Make sure their boots are on the right feet, that they can buckle properly. Look for too much clothing bunched in the cuff, or the shell overlapping the wrong way.
