### Why it's important

Equips students to be able to change directions on flat terrain, like in a lift line.

### How to do it

Put poles in the snow in front of the tips and have them move in a circle around their poles, keeping their tips close together and pointed at the poles the entire time.

### What to look for

Should leave a nice sunburst in the snow. Or a wagon wheel. Or even a snowflake.

### Other things you can do

Reverse it! Have them try the exact same thing with the poles directly behind the tails of their skis. Doing reverse paddle turns is a great way to set up herringbone.
