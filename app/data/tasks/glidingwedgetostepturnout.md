### Why it's important

Introduction of the wedge - the basic training wheels for skiing.

### How to do it

Demonstrate a stationery wedge stance first. If there are three sizes of wedges, 1 being a small wedge, and 3 being a very large wedge, demonstrate 2-sized wedge. Keep your knees over your toes with a slight bowl in the leg. Then, begin a glide down teh fall line for about 10 feet (or to a comfortable speed), and using small steps step in one direction across the fall line until you come to a stop.

### What to look for

Are the knees over the toes? Are they sitting back too far?

### Other things you can do

Play with all the feels: exaggerate fore and aft stance, ski tall and low. Play a game where you call out which wedge size for them to do as they glide down. Have them follow you and do what you do.
