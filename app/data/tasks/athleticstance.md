### Why it's important

Proper stance ensures the most efficient use of joints and muscles that are needed for skiing.

### How to do it

Demonstrate stance and talk about the relationship between the lower leg to the upper body. To show athletic position, hop in the air and then when you land, hold your position when all your joints are flexed, and arms outstretched, but not straight. Core tight and engaged.

### What to look for

The line from the ankle to the knee should be parallel to the line from the hip to the shoulder. Ankles, knees, hips, all flexed.

### Other things you can do

Plank lift a kid for more core tightness.
