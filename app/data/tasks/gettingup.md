### Why it's important

There are different ways to get up depending on slope angle and physiology.

### How to do it

Skis across fall line, downhill ski on first if it fell off. Reaching up the hill, place hand on snow or on pole close to hip, push up while rolling head toward the ski tips. If this is too difficult, have the student take their uphill ski off, stand, and then put the ski back on.

### Other things you can do

The V method. Starting on stomach with their head up hill, have them put their skis in a V, with the V pointing downhill. Walk hands back toward their body get up on knees, then push hands to stand.
