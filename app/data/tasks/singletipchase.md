### Why it's important

Equips students to be able to turn their feet using their legs instead of with their upper body with a focus on edge pressure.

### How to do it

Use the metaphor of a "magic button" that exists inside the cuff of the boot that we press on in order to apply pressure to the ski to get it to bend which makes it turn. Then, starting in a #2 size wedge, demonstrate pressing the magic button by pressing the shin into the cuff of the boot.

### What to look for

Pressure directed to the outside of ski in combination with movement along the length of the ski. Done properly it results in the ski steering separate of the upper body. You should see fore/aft (F1), edge to edge (F2), and feet steering (F3) fundamentals in action.
